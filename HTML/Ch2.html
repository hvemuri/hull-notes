      <h1 id="ch-2-mechanics-of-futures-markets">Ch 2 Mechanics of Futures Markets</h1>
<ul>
<li>vast majority of futures contracts do not lead to delivery<br>
– traders close out positions prior to delivery period specified in the contract</li>
<li>possibility of final delivery ties the futures price to the spot price</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="specification-of-a-futures-contract">Specification of a Futures Contract</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>exchange must specify the following in the contract<br>
– asset<br>
– contract size<br>
– where and when delivery can be made</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when party with short position is ready to deliver it files a <em>notice of intention to deliver</em><br>
– indicates grade of asset delivered and delivery location</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-asset">The Asset</h4>
<ul>
<li>when the asset is a commodity, there may be variation in the quality<br>
– exchange must stipulate the grade(s) that are acceptable<br>
– price may depend on the grade, with adjustments established by the exchange</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-contract-size">The Contract Size</h4>
<ul>
<li>contract size specifies the amount of the asset that has to be delivered under one contract<br>
– if too large: investors wishing to hedge small exposures or take small speculative positions cannot do so<br>
– if too small: trading may be expensive due to transaction costs</li>
<li>exchanges have introduced “mini” contracts to attract smaller investors</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="delivery-arrangements">Delivery Arrangements</h4>
<ul>
<li>exchange must specify where delivery will be made<br>
– price received by party with short position may be adjusted according to location chosen by that party, when alternative delivery locations are specified<br>
– price tends to be higher for delivery locations far from the main source of the commodity</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="delivery-months">Delivery Months</h4>
<ul>
<li>exchange must specify precise period during the month when delivery can be made<br>
– for many futures contracts the delivery period is the whole month</li>
<li>contracts trade for closest delivery month and a number of subsequent delivery months<br>
– exchange specifies when trading for a particular month’s contract begins and ends<br>
– trading usually ends a few days before the last day on which delivery can be made</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-quotes">Price Quotes</h4>
<ul>
<li>exchange defines how prices will be quoted<br>
– example: dollars and cents, or dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-limits-and-position-limits">Price Limits and Position Limits</h4>
<ul>
<li>exchange specifies daily price movement limits</li>
</ul>
<p>limit down - price moves down from previous day’s close by amount equal to daily price limit<br>
limit up - price moves up from previous day’s close by amount equal to daily price limit<br>
limit move - move in either direction equal to daily price limit</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>trading ceases for the day once contract is limit up or limit down<br>
– in some cases, the exchange can step in and change the limits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>purpose of daily price limits is to prevent large price movements due to speculative excesses<br>
– however, limits can become an artificial barrier to trading when price of underlying is changing rapidly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>position limits are max number of contracts that a speculator may hold<br>
– purpose is to prevent speculators from exercising undue influence on the market</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="converge-of-futures-price-to-spot-price">Converge of Futures Price to Spot Price</h2>
<ul>
<li>as delivery period approaches, futures price converges to spot price of underlying<br>
– when delivery period is reached, futures price equals spot price (roughly)<br>
– if not, arbitrage opportunities exist, causing prices to converge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="operation-of-margin-accounts">Operation of Margin Accounts</h2>
<ul>
<li>a key role of the exchange is to organize trading to avoid contract defaults</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="daily-settlement">Daily Settlement</h4>
<p>initial margin - amount that must be deposited at the time the contract is entered into</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>at EOD the margin account is adjusted to reflect investor’s gain/loss<br>
– known as <em>daily settlement</em> or <em>marking to market</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investor can withdraw any balance in margin account excess of initial margin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>maintenance margin - ensures balance in margin account never becomes negative</p>
<ul>
<li>lower than initial margin</li>
<li>if balance in margin account falls below maintenance margin, investor receives a <strong>margin call</strong><br>
– investor must fund margin account to the initial margin level by end of next day<br>
– extra funds known as <em>variation margin</em><br>
– if investor fails to do so, broker closes out the position</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="further-details">Further Details</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>most brokers pay investors interest on the balance in a margin account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investor can deposit securities with the broker to satisfy initial margin requirements<br>
– but not for margin calls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>minimum margin levels set by exchange clearing house<br>
– individual brokers may require greater margins from clients than those set by clearing house<br>
– minimum margin levels determined by variability of price of underlying<br>
– higher variability leads to higher margin levels<br>
– maintenance margin is usually ~75% of initial margin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>margin requirements may depend on trader objectives<br>
– hedger may have lower margin requirements than a speculator due to less risk of default</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>day trade - trader announces to broker an intent to close out position in the same day<br>
spread transaction - trader simultaneously buys a contract on an asset for one maturity month and sells a contact on the same asset for another maturity month</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>day trades and spread transactions give rise to lower margin requirements than do hedge transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>short futures positions have same margin requirements as long futures positions<br>
– not true of spot markets, where taking a short position involves selling an asset that is not owned</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-clearing-house-and-its-members">The Clearing House and its Members</h4>
<p>clearing house - acts as intermediary in futures transactions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>purpose is to keep track of all transactions that take place during a day to calculate net position of each of its members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>initial margin determination is based on number of contracts outstanding on a net basis<br>
– short positions are offset against long positions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearing house members required to contribute to a <em>guaranty fund</em><br>
– used by clearing house in the event a member fails to provide variation margin and there are losses when the member’s positions are closed out</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="credit-risk">Credit Risk</h4>
<ul>
<li>in Oct 1987 the S&amp;P 500 index declined sharply and traders with long positions in S&amp;P 500 futures had negative margin balances<br>
– those who did not meet margin calls were closed out but owed brokers money<br>
– some did not pay so brokers went bankrupt<br>
– however, clearing houses had sufficient funds to ensure everyone who had a short futures position got paid</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="otc-markets">OTC Markets</h2>
<ul>
<li>credit risk is a key feature of OTC derivatives markets</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="central-counterparties">Central Counterparties</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there are clearing houses for OTC transactions much like exchange clearing houses<br>
– members required to provide initial margin, daily variation margin, and contribute to guaranty fund</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearing house takes on credit risk of both parties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if OTC market participant is not a member of a CCP, it can arrange to clear its trade via a CCP member</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bilateral-clearing">Bilateral Clearing</h4>
<ul>
<li>OTC transactions not cleared via CCP are cleared bilaterally<br>
– two parties enter into a master agreement covering all their trades<br>
– often includes annex requiring one or both parties to provide collateral</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="futures-trades-vs-otc-trades">Futures Trades vs OTC Trades</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>initial margin when provided as cash usually earns interest<br>
– daily variation margin does not earn interest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transactions in OTC market are not settled daily so daily variation margin provided by members does earn interest when provided as cash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>securities can be used to satisfy margin or collateral requirements<br>
– market value of securities is reduced to determine their value for margin purposes<br>
– reduction is known as <strong>haircut</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="market-quotes">Market Quotes</h2>
<p>settlement price - price used for calculating daily gains/losses and margin requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>usually the price at which the contract traded immediately before the end of a day’s trading session</li>
</ul>
<p>trading volume - number of contracts traded in a day<br>
open interest - number of contracts outstanding</p>
<p>normal market - futures prices increase with maturity<br>
inverted market - futures prices decline with maturity</p>
<h2 id="delivery">Delivery</h2>
<ul>
<li>very few futures contracts lead to delivery of the underlying</li>
<li>period during which delivery can be made is defined by the exchange</li>
<li>decision on when to deliver is made by the party with the short position<br>
– notice of intention to deliver states how many contracts will be delivered and where delivery will be made and what grade will be delivered</li>
<li>exchange chooses a party with a long position to accept delivery<br>
– usually the party with the oldest outstanding long position</li>
<li>parties with long positions must accept delivery notices<br>
– may find another party with an outstanding long position to transfer the notice to</li>
<li>party taking delivery is responsible for all warehousing costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Three critical days for a contract</p>
<ol>
<li><em>first notice day</em> - first day on which a notice of intention to deliver can be submitted to the exchange</li>
<li><em>last notice day</em> - last day on which a notice of intention to deliver can be submitted to the exchange</li>
<li><em>last trading day</em> - usually a few days before the last notice day</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>investor should close long positions prior to first notice day to avoid risk of having to take delivery</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cash-settlement">Cash Settlement</h4>
<ul>
<li>some futures are settled in cash because it is inconvenient/impossible to deliver the underlying asset</li>
<li>outstanding contracts are declared closed on a predetermined day<br>
– final settlement price equals spot price of the underlying asset at either open or close of trading on that day</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-traders-and-types-of-orders">Types of Traders and Types of Orders</h2>
<p>Two main types of traders</p>
<ol>
<li><em>futures commission merchants</em> (FCMs)<br>
– following instructions of their clients and charge a commission for doing so</li>
<li><em>locals</em><br>
– trading on their own account</li>
</ol>
<p>scalpers - speculators watching for short-term trends and attempting to profit from small changes in the contract price; hold positions for only a few minutes</p>
<p>day traders - hold positions for less than one trading day</p>
<p>position traders - hold positions for much longer periods of time</p>
<h4 id="orders">Orders</h4>
<p>market order - request trade be carried out immediately at best price available in the market</p>
<p>limit order - specifies a particular price</p>
<ul>
<li>order can be executed only at this price or at one more favorable to the investor</li>
<li>no guarantee that order is executed at all</li>
</ul>
<p>stop order (stop-loss order) - specifies a particular price</p>
<ul>
<li>order is executed at best available price one a bid or offer is made at the particular price or a less favorable price</li>
<li>a stop order becomes a market order once the specified price has been reached</li>
<li>purpose is to close out a position if unfavorable price movements take place<br>
– limits the loss that can be incurred</li>
</ul>
<p>stop-limit order - combination of a stop order and a limit order</p>
<ul>
<li>becomes a limit order as soon as a bid or offer is made at a price equal to or less favorable than the stop price</li>
<li>must specify both the stop price and the limit price</li>
</ul>
<p>market-if-touched (MIT) order - executed at best available price after a trade occurs at a specified price or at a more favorable price than the specified price</p>
<ul>
<li>becomes a market order once the specified price has been reached</li>
<li>also known as a <em>board order</em></li>
<li>designed to ensure profits are taken if sufficiently favorable price movements occur</li>
</ul>
<p>discretionary order (market-not-held order) - traded as a market order except that execution may be delayed at the broker’s discretion in an attempt to get a better price</p>
<p>time-of-day order - specifies a particular period of time during the day when the order can be executed</p>
<p>open order (good-til-canceled order) - in effect until executed or until end of trading in the particular contract</p>
<p>fill-or-kill order - must be executed immediately or not at all</p>
<h2 id="regulation">Regulation</h2>
<p>Futures markets in the US are regulated by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>responsible for ensuring prices are communicated to the public</li>
<li>futures traders must report outstanding positions if above certain levels</li>
<li>licenses individuals who offer services to the public in futures trading</li>
<li>deals with complaints brought by public and ensures disciplinary action is taken when appropriate</li>
<li>has authority to force exchanges to take disciplinary action against members</li>
</ul>
<p>National Futures Association (NFA) - organization of individuals who participate in the futures industry</p>
<ul>
<li>objective is to prevent fraud and to ensure market operates in best interests of the public</li>
<li>authorized to monitor trading and take disciplinary action when appropriate</li>
<li>has efficient system for arbitrating disputes between individuals and its members</li>
</ul>
<p>Dodd-Frank act expanded role of CFTC</p>
<ul>
<li>now responsible for rules requiring that standard OTC derivates be traded on swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="trading-irregularities">Trading Irregularities</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>futures markets usually operate efficiently and in public interest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one type of irregularity is when investors <em>corner the market</em><br>
– investors take a huge long futures position and try to exercise control over supply of underlying commodity<br>
– as maturity approaches, investors do not close out positions, so number of outstanding futures contracts may exceed the amount of the commodity available for delivery<br>
– holders of short positions have difficulty delivering and try to close their positions<br>
– results in large rise in both futures and spot prices<br>
– regulators deal with this by increasing margin requirements or imposing stricter position limits or prohibiting trades that increase a speculator’s open position or requiring market participants to close out their positions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other irregularities<br>
– overcharging customers<br>
– not paying customers the full proceeds of sales<br>
– traders using knowledge of customer orders to first trade for themselves (<strong>front running</strong>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accounting-and-tax">Accounting and Tax</h2>
<h4 id="accounting">Accounting</h4>
<ul>
<li>if contract does not qualify has a hedge<br>
– changes in market value of futures contract are recognized when they occur</li>
<li>if contract does qualify as a hedge<br>
– gains/losses are recognized in the same period in which gains/losses from item being hedged are recognized (<em>hedge accounting</em>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tax">Tax</h4>
<ul>
<li>gains/losses are either capital gains/losses or part of ordinary income</li>
<li>for corporate taxpayers, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income<br>
– ability to deduct losses is restricted</li>
<li>positions in futures contracts treated as if closed out on last day of tax year</li>
<li>gains/losses from hedging transactions are treated as ordinary income</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="forward-vs-futures-contracts">Forward vs Futures Contracts</h2>
<ul>
<li>both are agreements to buy or sell an asset for a certain price at a certain future time<br>
– forwards are traded in OTC markets with no standard contract size or standard delivery arrangements<br>
– futures have standardized contracts traded on an exchange</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="profits-from-forward-and-futures-contracts">Profits from Forward and Futures Contracts</h4>
<ul>
<li>with forwards, the whole gain or loss is realized at the end of life of the contract</li>
<li>with futures, the gain or loss is realized day by day because of daily settlement procedures</li>
</ul>
